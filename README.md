Additional Notes:
The predict_pipeline.py script assumes the existence of a load_object utility function to load the saved model and preprocessor.
The train_pipeline.py script includes the steps to build, compile, train, and save the CNN model and preprocessor.
The paths for saving and loading models and preprocessors are configurable and can be adjusted as per your directory structure. Ensure that directories like artifacts exist in your project.
